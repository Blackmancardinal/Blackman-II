BLACKMAN II is a virtual assistant for OS X, Windows and Linux systems. He
currently uses Google Chrome's speech-to-text engine, OS X's ``say``
command, Linux's ``espeak`` command or Ivona TTS along with some magical
scripting which makes him alive, developed by `Tanay
Pant <http://tanaypant.com>`__ and a group of sorcerers. The Web UI for
BLACKMAN II has been designed by `KOFI BLACKMAN <http://Blackmangroupofcompanies.in>`__.
